## How to run executable:
## make sure to have the independencies placed in C:\Users\Public\OpenGL
![image]()

## when the project is ran, you will see 6 faces, pointed towards a spinning ring, while a light travels around it. the scene is covered by a heavy fog.
## you can move around using WASD and use the shift key to speed up. use the mouse to look around. you must click and hold on the window to move the camera.

## I chose to go with Phongg lighting mixed with the fog and toon shading. it gives the scene a retro feel, especially with the texture applied to the faces, which have a distored texture
## I find this aesthetically pleasing, while its also simpler to create.

## I created all the models and textures seen apart from the plane and moss texture used, and the skybox - which doesnt work on the current shader and requires its own.

## The dependencies used are
### GLAD
### GLFW
### GLM
### KHR
